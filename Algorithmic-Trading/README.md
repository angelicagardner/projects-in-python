# Algorithmic Trading

This project contains several AI/ML projects focused on algorithmic trading strategies. Each notebook aims to explore and implement different aspects or strategies, leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques to optimize performance and manage risk.

Inspired by the [Algorithmic Trading Using Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzGZB4HhEE) and [Machine Learning & Quant Strategies Algorithmic Trading Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y3yaoi9rUQ).

Dataset used from [s-and-p-500-companies](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies) which is a list of companies in the S&P 500 together with associated financials, together with the `yfinance` package to retrieve

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund**:

- Create a model to manage an investment portfolio that equally weights the components of the S&P 500 Index.
- Unlike a market-cap-weighted index where larger companies have a greater influence, an equal-weight index gives each company the same importance.
- Model predicts stock performance, rebalance the portfolio, and optimize returns.
